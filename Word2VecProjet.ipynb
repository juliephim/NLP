      "Five example query IDs and their texts:\n",
      "Query ID: PLAIN-1, Query Text: why deep fried foods may cause cancer in the latest study on dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among women , healthier eating was associated with eliminating three-quarters of the odds of breast cancer , whereas less healthy eating was associated with up to nearly eight times the odds . included in the unhealthy eating pattern was the consumption of deep-fried foods , which have previously been linked to breast cancer , pancreatic cancer , lung cancer , oral and throat cancers , esophageal cancer , and cancer of the voicebox . no deep fried foods ? what ’ s a southern belle to do ? instead of deep fried foods , how about the traditional southern diet , characterized by high intakes of cooked greens , beans , legumes , cabbage , sweet potatoes and cornbread , which may reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer significantly . what about the consumption of deep-fried foods and risk of prostate cancer ? researchers at the fred hutchinson cancer research center and the university of washington found that eating french fries , fried chicken , fried fish , and doughnuts was associated with about a third greater odds of prostate cancer . after stratifying for tumor aggressiveness , they found slightly stronger associations with more aggressive disease , suggesting that regular intake of deep-fried foods may contribute to the progression of prostate cancer as well . what in deep fried foods is so bad for us ? just heating oil that hot can generate potentially carcinogenic compounds , and then known carcinogens such as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons form when the muscles of chickens and fish are cooked at that temperature . deep-fried plants , on the other hand , can form acrylamide . i did a video about acrylamide back in 2008 , suggesting it ’ s a probable human carcinogen ( see acrylamide in french fries ) . since then , studies have suggested pregnant women may want to cut back on french fries to protect the growth of their baby ’ s body and brain . based on a study ( highlighted in my video , cancer risk from french fries ) feeding people a little bag of potato chips every day for a month , it now seems acrylamide may also cause inflammation as well , which could explain its purported role in cancer progression . acrylamide intake has been associated with endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , lung cancer , kidney cancer , and esophageal cancer . how much cancer risk are we talking about ? taiwanese researchers examined lifetime cancer risk and french fry consumption . the researchers picked on french fries because they comprise by far the greatest percentage contribution of acrylamide to the diets of children . they estimated that , at most , one or two boys and girls out of every ten thousand would develop cancer eating french fries that they would otherwise not have developed if they hadn ’ t eaten french fries . so it ’ s not as bad as eating something like fried fish , or fried chicken , but how much is that saying ? the level of cancer risk in both boys and girls associated with french fries depends on how long and hot they ’ re fried . in europe , the food industry swore that they ’ d self-regulate and control fry times to decrease acrylamide levels , but we ’ ve yet to see any subsequent change in acrylamide levels in french fries . researchers continue to urge that the cooking temperature should be as low as possible and the cooking time should be as short as possible , “ while still maintaining a tasty quality ” of course . we wouldn ’ t want to reduce cancer risk too much — they might not taste as good ! blanching the potatoes first reduces acrylamide formation , but potato chip companies complain that , not only would it muck with the flavor , but it would reduce the nutritional properties by leaching away some of the vitamin c. but if we ’ re relying on potato chips to get our vitamin c , acrylamide is probably the least of our worries . more on heterocyclic amines : there are some things we can do to counteract the effects of these carcinogens , though : i touch on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in meat fumes : dietary secondhand smoke and is liquid smoke flavoring carcinogenic ? certain fats may play a role in breast cancer survival as well : breast cancer survival , butterfat , and chicken and breast cancer survival and trans fat . even before the oil gets in the fryer , it ’ s been heavily damaged by the refining process . the multi-step process to take a whole food seed to a refined oil leaves behind oxidized , reactive fatty acids and chemical residues.does this refining process oxidize vegan dha pills , making these fats harmful ? i hope not . great question ! of the well known dietary fatty acids , dha has the highest peroxidation index . do the manufactures add an antioxidant to their dha products ? agreed , great question ! it may be more of a question for the manufacturer . we do know that dha oil from algae appear effective . another study here.yes , but does the dha vegan supplement also provide epa , or just dha ? this is important , no ? i ’ ve seen most vegan dha supplements make no mention of the product containing epa . fish oil has both . maybe you can clear this up for me , i assume i am missing something here in the understanding.leslie : i ’ ve seen quite a few commercial , algea-based omega three pills which include both dha and epa . here ’ s just one example ( not one i ’ m promoting . just the first one that popped up in a random search ) : http : / / www.devanutrition.com / vegan-dha-epa-delayed-release-omega-3.htmli ’ m sure there are also pills with just the dha , but i don ’ t think it is hard to find ones with the epa too if that ’ s what you want.how is it that some algae provide both dha and epa , and others do not ? i figured that algae in itself always contained both the dha and epa , as fish oil contains both dha and epa and the fish get it from eating algae . but some vegan companies say just dha . hmmmm … .leslie : i had assumed that the difference between different pill claims was due to different processing techniques . but you could be right . it could be that the pills which only claim to have dha are simply not reporting the epa ? i really have no clue.hi leslie : most algal dha supplements contain only dha . increasingly though there ’ re products with both dha and epa . if you type in “ vegan omega-3 ″ on amazon , you can find them , but they are even more expensive than algal dha-only products . it ’ s , of course , good to take both dha and epa but not essential because dha and epa equilibrate in the body : if you took only dha , some of it would be converted to epa , and vice versa.i find it thought provoking that the fish oil companies are shifting to balancing their dha epa supplement to contain more epa than dha , as a greater amount of epa than dha in the body has been found to be more effective for mood issues , as well as some feel other issues as well . vegans may be compromising themselves by taking dha only … .creating a level of dha and epa that might adversely effect them.http : / / www.nutraingredients-usa.com / research / epa-stands-alone-as-a-depression-fighterhttps : / / labdoor.com / article / epa-to-dha-ratio-a-benefits-and-risks-analysisseems like a good question for one of the manufacturers like nordic.from the study you linked tohttp : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23651876 dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among women . “ the ‘ healthy ’ food pattern was characterized by the consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy products , legumes , olive and vegetable oils , fish , condiments , organ meat , poultry , pickles , soya and whole grains ; while the ‘ unhealthy ’ food pattern was characterized by the consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea and coffee , french fries and potato chips , salt , sweets and desserts , hydrogenated fats , nuts , industrial juice , refined grains , and red and processed meat . ” so – the “ healthy food pattern ” included low fat dairy , olive and vegetable oils , organ meat and poultry ” ! ! and excluded tea ! ? ! this study exemplifies the importance of the ability to read the study and understand the statistical method in order to interpret the study correctly . they did what is known as principal component analysis ( https : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / principal _ component _ analysis ) as their factor analytic technique . the goal was dimension reduction prior to statistical analysis , not a direct inference of a best-fit ‘ healthy ’ pattern and a best fit ‘ unhealthy ’ pattern — really this would make no sense for a two-factor model since the unhealthiest pattern would be simply the negative of the healthiest pattern and there would only be one factor.the correct interpretation of their statistics is that : 1 ) they first found two orthogonal factors which varied significantly in their sample . that is , there is ‘ a-type ’ variation in which consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy , etc , all increase together , and some of the other dietary components decrease . then there is ‘ b-type ’ variation in which consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea , etc all increase together , and some other dietary components decrease . the sample diets from the ffq varied from person to person a fair bit in both the a-way and the b-way . the study calls them ‘ healthy ’ and ‘ unhealthy ’ but based on the characteristics given they could also plausibly be called ‘ traditional / rural ’ and ‘ urban / industrial ’ . 2 ) in a model that looked at both a-ness and b-ness of diets as independent variables , a-ness was found to associate with higher breast cancer risk while b-ness was found to associate with lower risk . if you had to pick between a-ness and b-ness as the only ways in which you could vary your diet to protect yourself from breast cancer , your best bet would be to reduce b and increase a. that said , a and b cannot be interpreted simply as straightforward lists of healthy / unhealthy things . in fact there are very obvious reasons why tea consumption would tend to increase along with all the other refined and processed foods , that have nothing to do with tea ’ s health per se . there are also obvious reasons why organ meats might be more common among people with greater access to other fresh and traditional foods , that have nothing to do with the health of organ meats per se.if you had to ask me the study is valuable but it doesn ’ t do much to pinpoint exactly what is good or bad for breast cancer . we rely on other research in order to interpret what the healthiest dietary pattern for preventing breast cancer might be . note that in greger ’ s article the study in question is only introduced as the latest , not the greatest . in many respects , the study isn ’ t all that great.this is what dr greger said – “ healthier eating was associated with eliminating three-quarters of the odds of breast cancer , whereas less healthy eating was associated with up to nearly eight times the odds ” again – the healthier eating pattern included vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy products , legumes , olive and vegetable oils , fish , condiments , organ meat , poultry , pickles , soya and whole grains.no matter how you want to spin it you can ’ t.however it would be useful if the good doctor would post a link to the entire study not just the abstract.the study is freely accessible , charles , and can be reached from the source link to the publisher on greger ’ s pubmed citation . greger is quoting his results from table 3 , model ii . i should mention that i misspoke a bit in calling these models ‘ univariate ’ . they focus on only one pattern at a time as the independent variable of interest , but their other statistical controls such as age , menopausal status , etc , are independent variables also . note that i haven ’ t said anything about the quality of greger ’ s reporting on the study yet , either . given that your op talked about the study and not what greger said , i assumed we were talking about what the study itself means.read the study and try to comprehend what i wrote as something other than ‘ spin ’ , then i might get back to you . i assure you that they found two patterns which spanned about 24-31 % of dietary variation in the population , then asked how healthy those patterns actually were . they did not ask up front “ what is the pattern whose variation explains the greatest variation in health outcomes ? ” . the latter form of questioning is well-framed to get you a list that distinguishes apparently healthy foods from apparently unhealthy , while the former is not.this study exemplifies the importance of the ability to read the study and understand the statistical method in order to interpret the study correctly . they did what is known as principal component analysis ( https : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / principal _ component _ analysis ) as their factor analytic technique . the goal was dimension reduction prior to statistical analysis , not a direct inference of a best-fit ‘ healthy ’ pattern and a best fit ‘ unhealthy ’ pattern — really this would make no sense for a two-factor model since the unhealthiest pattern would be simply the negative of the healthiest pattern and there would only be one factor.the correct interpretation of their statistics is that : 1 ) they first found two orthogonal factors which varied significantly in their sample . that is , there is ‘ a-type ’ variation in which consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy , etc , all increase together , and some of the other dietary components decrease . then there is ‘ b-type ’ variation in which consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea , etc all increase together , and some other dietary components decrease . the sample diets from the ffq varied from person to person a fair bit in both the a-way and the b-way . the study calls them ‘ healthy ’ and ‘ unhealthy ’ but based on the characteristics given they could also plausibly be called ‘ traditional / rural ’ and ‘ urban / industrial ’ . 2 ) in a model that looked at both a-ness and b-ness of diets as independent variables , a-ness was found to associate with higher breast cancer risk while b-ness was found to associate with lower risk . if you had to pick between a-ness and b-ness as the only ways in which you could vary your diet to protect yourself from breast cancer , your best bet would be to reduce b and increase a. that said , a and b cannot be interpreted simply as straightforward lists of healthy / unhealthy things . in fact there are very obvious reasons why tea consumption would tend to increase along with all the other refined and processed foods , that have nothing to do with tea ’ s health per se . there are also obvious reasons why organ meats might be more common among people with greater access to other fresh and traditional foods , that have nothing to do with the health of organ meats per se.if you had to ask me the study is valuable but it doesn ’ t do much to pinpoint exactly what is good or bad for breast cancer . we rely on other research in order to interpret what the healthiest dietary pattern for preventing breast cancer might be . note that in greger ’ s article the study in question is only introduced as the latest , not the greatest . in many respects , the study isn ’ t all that great.a litttle more nuancing might help . i obtain lots of vegetable from my grocery garden , wich i store in my freezer for winter time , after boiling it for a short minute . i may hope that that is not so bad ! as i understand , boiling in water and steaming don ’ t cause acrylamide formation . it ’ s the burning of plant foods due to dry heating that leads to acrylamide.thanks ! the issue for me with fat supplementation is this ; many many people arer taking all kinds of omega ’ s , olive , primrose oils etc . can we clarify the research as to how they oxidize and cause damage ? they layman really has no idea on how to proceed and not create chaos with the oils they take . now dr peter glidden is against all oils for the most part . i think he makes an exception for youngevity efa and maybe coconut oils . any help to clarify would go a long way.great point , anthony . a guest below also had a comment about oxidation . maybe this can be another nutritionfacts research fund project ? dr. greger has a video about the true shelf life of cooking oils . it would be nice to see more on the oils you mention.so would fried coconut oil be safe , and organic potato chips fried in just organic coconut oil not be an issue / problem , as far as arrylamide content as well as oxidation , inflammation ? wondering what you think about this . i have no idea.is it safe to bake potatoes , etc. in the oven brushed with a little olive oil ? what is the temperature at which acrylamide formation becomes a concern ? hi jan . here is a video about the best way to cook sweet potatoes . it ’ s really the french fries ( deep frying ) that is problematic , as they are laden with acrylamide . here is a study looking at acrylamide and temperature . this study mentions how cooking time and temperature may determine acrylamide levels.i watched that video & i like the fact that dr. greger won ’ t compromise quantity of good food vs. quality .. he mentions that best way of eating such a healthy food as sweet potato is how you get most of it .. therefore if someone doesn ’ t have time or facility to boil , they don ’ t have to stop eating it ! one can bake & eat more of it to get same nutrients . that obviously doesn ’ t apply to french fries , but reminds me about some schools or work places , which only provide students / employees with french fries & no better alternative . here the challenge is either eat the deep fried potatoes or stay hungry .. this is a much more difficult decision to make , and for me as an advocate for public health is an example of how important is infrastructure changes to have healthier nation.good information . i will be sharing the informationi will be lurking around the net trying to find out about the dangers of oxidation of oils . if anyone else finds anything please post.beast carcinogen indeedhow about air popped popcorn ? hot temperature ? starch ? short cooking time ? sounds like a recipe for acrylamide . i would be bummed … i love my air popped popcorn. acrylamide , beans , breast cancer , cabbage , cancer , cancer survival , carcinogens , chicken , children , cooking methods , doughnuts , endometrial cancer , endometrial health , esophageal cancer , esophageal health , europe , fish , french fries , frying , greens , heterocyclic amines , industry influence , inflammation , kidney cancer , legumes , lung cancer , men 's health , oils , oral cancer , ovarian cancer , pancreatic cancer , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , potato chips , poultry , prostate cancer , sweet potatoes , throat cancer , turkey , vitamin c , women 's health - -\n",

      "Query ID: PLAIN-101, Query Text: how to treat multiple sclerosis with diet multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable and frightening degenerative autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system in which our body attacks our own nerves . it often strikes in the prime of life and can cause symptoms in the brain , such as cognitive impairment ; in the eye , such as painful loss of vision ; as well as tremors , weakness , loss of bladder control , pain , and fatigue . the most frequently prescribed drug for multiple sclerosis is interferon beta , which can make one feel lousy and cost $ 30,000 a year . but hey , it might be worthwhile — if it actually worked . we learned recently that it doesn ’ t seem to prevent or delay long-term disability . that leaves chemo drugs like mitoxantrone that causes irreversible heart damage in one out of every eight people who go on the drug and causes cancer ( leukemia ) in nearly 1 % of people who take it . but ms is no walk in the park either . if only there was a cheap , simple , safe , side-effect free solution that also just so happened to be the most effective treatment for ms ever prescribed … dr. roy swank , who we lost recently at age 99 , was a distinguished neurologist whose research culminated in over 170 scientific papers . in the video , treating multiple sclerosis with the swank ms diet , i highlight a few . as far back as 1950 , we knew there were areas in the world that had a lot of ms — north america , europe — and other places — africa and asia — that hardly had any . and migration studies show that those who move from a high risk area to a low risk area significantly drop their risk , and vice versa . so it seems less genetic and more lifestyle . dr. swank had an idea . as he recounts in an interview with dr. john mcdougall at the ripe young age of 84 , “ it seemed possible to me that this could be a matter of food , because the further north you go the less vegetarian a life is led and the more people are carnivores , you might say — they spend a lot more time eating meat . ” after looking at the multiple sclerosis data from world war ii in occupied countries where meat and dairy were rationed , along with his famous study in ’ 52 that found that the frequency of ms related directly to the amount of saturated animal fat consumed daily in different areas of norway , he concluded that it might be the animal fat that was causing the increased risk . he decided to put it to the test by restricting people ’ s intake of saturated animal fat , most commonly coming from dairy and chicken in the u.s. ( see trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol : tolerable upper intake of zero ) . in treating multiple sclerosis with the swank ms diet , you can see data on his first 47 patients before cutting out about 90 % of the saturated fat from their diet and after , showing a decrease in both the frequency and severity of ms attacks . normally , we ’ re lucky if we can get people to stick to a diet for six months , and so that ’ s why most dietary trials last a year at the most . the first study he published reported results from the first three and a half years . then came the five and a half year follow-up in which he added about another 100 patients . then the seven year follow-up , published in the annals of internal medicine . then the 20 year follow-up , and then the 34 year follow-up . how did his patients do ? if we can get to people early in their disease , when they ’ re only mildly disabled , and restrict their saturated fat intake , dr. swank showed he could stop their disease in 95 % of cases — no further disability 34 years later . but if they started slacking on their diet — even years in , their disease could become reactivated . they felt so great that some felt that they could cheat a little bit , since they had their disease so well under control . but eating just eight grams of saturated fat more a day was accompanied by a striking increase in disability and a near tripling of their death rate . how about a 50 year follow-up ! they were able to track down 15 of the original patients that stuck to the diet , now in their 70s and 80s , with multiple sclerosis for over 50 years , and 13 out of 15 were walking around normal in all respects . conclusion : “ this study indicated that , in all probability , ms is caused largely by consumption of saturated animal fat . ” dr. swank thought it was the sludging of the blood caused by even a single meal of saturated fats that can clog tiny capillaries that feed our nervous system . diets rich in saturated fat and cholesterol can thicken the blood and make our red cells sticky . a single meal of sausage and eggs can stick our blood cells together like rolls of quarters . and that kind of hyperaggregation can lead to a reduction of blood flow and oxygenation of our tissues . what ’ s in sausage and eggs that may cause so much inflammation ? see my video series on endotoxins described in my blog how does meat cause inflammation ? if we put someone ’ s blood through a machine that sucks out about 90 % of the cholesterol in their blood , we can demonstrate an immediate improvement in microcirculation in the heart muscle . but what about the brain ? the eyes are the windows … to our brain . we can visualize — in real-time — changes in blood vessel function in the retina at the back of the eye , which gives us a sense of what ’ s happening further back in the brain . and if we lower the cholesterol level in the blood , we can immediately get a significant improvement in vasodilation — the little veins open wider and let the blood flow . so yes , it could be the animal fat leading to clogging of our capillaries , but now we know animal fats can have all sorts of other deleterious effects such as inflammation , so who knows what the actual mechanism may be by which cutting animal fat can cut ms progression . regardless , patients with ms that follow a diet with no more than 10 or 15 grams of saturated fat can expect to survive and thrive to a ripe old age . of course , cutting out saturated fat completely might be better , given that heart disease is our number one killer . the bottom line is that the results dr. swank published remain “ the most effective treatment of multiple sclerosis ever reported in the peer reviewed medical literature . ” in patients with early stage ms , 95 % were without progression of their disease 34 years later after adopting his low saturated fat dietary program . even patients with initially advanced disease showed significant benefit . to date , no medication or invasive procedure has ever even come close , to demonstrating such success . doesn ’ t cost $ 30,000 dollars ; doesn ’ t give you leukemia — and works . better ! this all begs one big obvious question : if dr. swanks results are “ so stunningly impressive , why haven ’ t other physicians , neurologists , and centers adopted this method of treatment ? ” one reason may be that mri machines weren ’ t invented until the 1970s , decades after dr. swank ’ s study began . mris are how we track the progress of ms today . we don ’ t have to rely on patients ’ subjective reports or doctor ’ s clinical judgments , we can see the disease get better or worse right there in black and white . it ’ s like in the 1970s when nathan pritikin appeared to reverse heart disease by the thousands but no one took him seriously until angiography was invented and the likes of ornish and esselstyn ( see our number one killer can be stopped ) could hold up angiographic images , proving conclusively that a plant-based diet could help literally open up arteries . so what we need is someone to repeat swank ’ s experiment today with mri scans every step of the way . and i ’ m happy to report that exact experiment was just completed by dr. john mcdougall . dr. swank was one of dr. mcdougall ’ s heroes , and dr. mcdougall is one of mine . study enrollment was completed last year and we should have the full results soon . i touched on this in my live 2013 year-in-review lecture more than an apple a day , but i ’ m excited to be able to take a deeper dive into this extraordinary story . those interested in supporting dr. mcdougall ’ s landmark study ( headed by dr. dennis bourdette , m.d. and under the supervision of dr. vijayshree yadav ) can donate to his nonprofit mcdougall research & education foundation ( you can also donate to nutritionfacts.org to help keep us bringing you similarly underreported yet life-saving science ) . this is exciting information for those with ms. i am wondering , however , if there is any recent information that would help those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . i understand there is currently a study program in place testing a product called pirfinidone . if you have any information on this or any other study , including , of course , diet , that would benefit those with ipf , it would be greatly appreciated since few people with ipf survive longer than eight years , and someone very near and dear to me is struggling with this condition.systemic enzymes are fantastic for lysing any type of fibrosis in the body . they are taken on an empty stomach so they can be absorbed. http : / / www.totalityofbeing.com / framelesspages / articles / copdandpulmonaryfibrosis.htmthank you for this information . i will definitely look into it.the reason for the lack of interest by both the public and medical profession could be that diet is not considered relevant to ms. outside heartburn and allergies , diet is still a fringe treatment to most medical professionals , who use sound bytes rather than research to determine what to prescribe . the research here is clear and the sound bytes override it , to the detriment of all but the most intelligent public who read nutritionfacts.org.someone needs to do a study on essential tremor like these ms studies . i ’ ve been using a whole-food , plant-based diet for years to manage et and believe it is not progressing . if we can stop the progression of et with diet , it would help tens of millions of people . please , some of you clinical nutritionists , put some of your et patients on a plant-based diet and lets find out if it stops the progression . the typical et patient gets 10 % worse tremor symptoms each year . it should be easy after a few years to tell if the diet is effective.dr. terry wahls cured her severe ms with a paleo diet . nine cups of fruits and vegetables per day , no dairy , no gluten and clean living.i was granted my medical doctorate with honor with the work i did on ms. 1 / the target is oligodendrocyte , the cell producing myeline , and wrapping more than 1 axon , protecting the neuron and the neuro-transmission . it is a disease reversible starting in blood , entering the blood brain barrier through an inflammatory reaction from may different origins , 2 / creating an inflammatory reaction before destroying an oligodendrocyte which is the key point of reversibility . when you understand this first step , you start to eat organic , to have 60 % or more in vegetables to get enough antioxydant , to have good fat as avocados to be sure to maintain a balance without reaction . the japanese people living japanese style have no ms , it is not genetic , they have ms when in europe or the us , nutrition looks as the key . the work i did between 1974 to 1985 has inspired more work , all scientific data and lifestyle changes are consistent with a response by the brain cells to an agent brought from the blood from nutriments.great work , thanks . is there also a link between diet and motor neuron disease ? i ’ ve read something about a role for the myelin sheath in that disease too.yes , i did a very extensive work on japanese diet and neurology . all concerning the myelin look better when having a rich anti oxidant food , virgin cold pressed fat oil , no addition of sugar and twice or more portion of fish a week. to say it in simple word , neuro transmission , moto neurons included needs to have active signal , nothing must interfere , simple and rich food as japanese , or real mediterranean are protecting the neuro transmission bringing the elements needed without shutting down the signals , we need phospholipids , clean onesare omega 3s from flax seeds ok instead of fish ? just i did not answer your question , excuse me , i was with the nutrition . oligodendrocytes are the cells making the myelin sheath in a sort of knitting / woven work . i worked on the interaction of the cells to build this sheath around the axon and protect the conduction and the neurotransmission . each part of axon is wrapped by different pieces coming from different cells as if one is damaged the portion of neuron is protected by an other one coming from another cell , security is in place . the ms is the destruction of this myelin sheath , there are phase of inflammation , that makes neuro signs reversible and phase of destruction and then it is scares , we have less chance to reverse , whatever the plasticity of the brain cells , oligodendrocytes included can do migration to repair the damaged portioni had carbon monoxide poisoning at 1 1 / 2 years of age which led me with lesions in my brain … at age 69 i have symptoms of ms and veggies and eating well really helps , i had symptoms all along , tiredness , tingling , numbness , incontinence , etc and never made the connection to co2 poisoning … even though i have these problems i am relieved to know it was probably caused by an accident at an early age … i deal better this way .. before it was just fear if unknown.an accident as you had may be responsible of the signs you describe . i was ordering water gym , to my patients having an acute accident to avoid progressive worsening due to pain when moving. at 69 you know how to deal with it and limit the discomfort.and what about dr. terry wahls , who reversed her secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis with a micronutrient-dense diet and paleo principles ? according to her , some meat , some animal saturated fats , eggs are essential for treating ms with diet : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = f2ya3qpddlm ( dr. terry wahls ’ protocol that reversed multiple sclerosis ) i was wondering the same thing … i ’ m reading dr wahls book now and she emphasises the importance of incorporating grass fed meat and wild fish etc in one ’ s daily diet … so which is best follow ? meat or no meat ? dr. wahl ’ s diet as listed below , is incredibly nutrient dense * despite * the inclusion of animal foods.from my limited reading ( i have not read her book ) , she seems to emphasize omega-3s , which is perhaps why she is endorsing “ grass-fed ” meat or certain fish . why she doesn ’ t use plant-based sources for omega-3s is unclear . perhaps because she was already inclined towards eating a paleo diet ( during which she continued to decline ) before starting the vegetable-heavy nutrient dense regime described below ( as a result of which she improved ) . perhaps this paleo inclination has resulted in an aversion to flax or chia seeds , or perhaps she feels she requires long chain omega-3s , though she could of course consume this in the form of algae.i suspect that being off all grains and potatoes , she requires something calorically dense to simply survive and function , and has found that in low micronutrient but high calorie animal foods.in any case , with all of the veggies she eats per day , the room left for animal foods is scant . i can ’ t imagine her eating a large amount of animal foods on top of all of those veggies.so on one hand , we have multiple , highly reproducible studies showing a high plant food low saturated fat diet works for ms. on the other hand , we have an n = 1 anecdotal tale about someone who eats an obviously high plant food diet and has also corrected her ms. depending on the amount of animal foods she consumes , there may or may not be very much significant disagreement here . it would be interesting to know her saturated fat intake . perhaps it is lower than people are inferring from her dietary description , or perhaps it is higher than those on the swank diet , but her 9 cups of veggies per day are also higher than those on the swank diet , and are providing a therapeutic effect to mitigate the effect of the fats . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ dr. wahl ’ s diet : 3 cups of cruciferous and dark greens3 cups intensely coloured : 1 cup red vegetables / fruit , 1 cup blue black vegetables / fruits , 1 cup yellow / orange vegetable / fruits3 cups others including : 1 cup mushrooms / onion family ( for organic sulphur ) , and seaweed for iodine and trace minerals.include spices and herbs.omega 3 rich foods , green leaves and animals fed green leaves , wild fish and seafood . and you could add fish oil.eat organ meats once per weekregular bone brothfermented foods or a probioticb00mer : you hit the points i wanted to make , but you did so a lot more robustly and elegantly than i would have . i was going to compare to the “ mediterranean diet ” and quote ( to the best of my memory ) jeff novick : “ were they healthy * because * of the olive oil or * inspite * of it ? ” without clinical trials on dr. wahl ’ s diet , we have to use common sense to determine which parts ( or all ) of her diet were likely the cause of her personal , anecdotal success.thanks for your post.thanks thea . i had jeff novick ’ s quotation in my mind as well . funny how people love to pick out the single least significant and least healthful food out of an overall healthy diet to glorify e.g. olive oil or goat cheese with the mediterraneans , fish with the japanese , etc.i could only stand to watch about half of the video as it was achingly unscientific , but the word i heard a million times was micronutrients micronutrients micronutrients . what exactly does micronutrient intake have to do with eating meat ? nothing , unless you ’ re trying to minimize it.she also flippantly mentions “ the essential fats are important too ” , specifically mentioning saturated fat , which of course is nonessential . and in the same breath attempts to relate it to plasma membrane fluidity , which is inversely related to saturated fat composition.it is astounding that someone that displays ignorance about such extremely basic biochem and nutrition principles is given a platform to speak about diet and health . of course , if her message of micronutrients and essential fas is getting cleverly construed to = > eat meat and saturated fat and be healthy , well , i ’ m sure she ’ ll sell a lot of books.b00mer : you gave me my laugh for the day . : - ) thanks for that additional analysis / info . wow . wow . wow . reminds me of jon stewart ’ s responses to certain politicians and our media . painful , but it ’ s better to laugh than cry.dr. wahls ’ experience is not anecdotal or based on one person . she has been doing clinical trials on patients with her diet for the last year . and thousands of people are using her diet plan with amazing success . just visit her facebook page . the brain uses fat for fuel , not glucose . i like everything about this site except its obvious vegan fanaticism.ehm … the first fuel for brain is glucose , and if there are problems with glucose supply then body starts to use ketones body from fat catabolism … http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / human _ brain # metabolismif fat are really primary sources for the brain why does gluconeogenesis exists ? i found a review that could answer some question about the brain preference for glucose instead of atty acids : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23921897in another review the authors talk about the brain areas that regulate glucose homeostasis : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23913677or this text : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / books / nbk22436 / or another : http : / / books.google.it / books ? id = bpoeqasaploc & printsec = frontcover & dq = glucose + and + the + brain & hl = it & sa = x & ei = rd73u8 _ rd-zo7aaylyhyba & ved = 0cceq6aewaa # v = onepage & q & f = falsei think it covers pretty much every brain metabolism … of course it could be more difficult than that : http : / / www.nature.com / jcbfm / journal / v23 / n6 / abs / 9591414a.htmlto me , glucose is of primary importance , then cames the other substrates … there are no articles linked to on her facebook page.on her personal website , she lists only three articles , * none * of which examine the role of fat in treatment of ms : – one article has no dietary intervention component whatsoever . – the other two articles examine up to five other physical , exercise , and lifestyle related interventions in conjuction with dietary interventions including up to 17 supplements and huge amounts of nutrient dense green and sulfur containing vegetables . again , there is no evidence presented to suggest that her patients are in fact consuming large amounts of saturated fat.compare these * two * multifactoral , small ( literally one was n = 1 ) , uncontrolled , short-term studies with the longest running , most successful study on ms in the history of medical literature , which * specifically studies * dietary saturated fat and its effect on ms.there is no comparison between the work of swank and wahls.if you or others purchase her books and see personal progress , that is interesting , but anecdotal.if she ’ s got a study in the works that she can 1 ) actually get published , that would 2 ) actually validate what she says about fat , then i ’ ll be interested to read it.but this website is based on modern science and what that means is peer reviewed literature , not anecdotes and hearsay . you could even say we ’ re fanatical about that . until dr. wahls actually publishes * any * literature showing that fat is beneficial for ms patients , there really isn ’ t any valid scientific conversation to be had about it.the articles she lists on her website study the following : 1. neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( nmes ) and physical therapy improves gait2. a case study of one woman using physical therapy , home exercise and stretching , nmes , and a diet of 600 grams of cruciferous vegetables , 300 grams of brightly colored fruits or vegetables , 60 to 100 grams of meat , poultry or fish , 4 supplements , and no milk , eggs , or gluten . the patient specifically mentions in her own words that it is when she fails to consume the cruciferous vegetables , she experiences a decline in energy and mental focus.3. the effect of stretching , strength exercise , meditation , massage , electrical stimulation , and a “ modified paleolithic ” diet ( specifically encouraging green and sulfur containing vegetables as well as 17 supplements ) on fatigue – in the author ’ s own words , it was a small , uncontrolled pilot study , and their only conclusions were that it improved fatigue and that people followed the plan relatively well.as far back as the 1980s when i was a practicing natural nutritionist , mds would recommend their patients see me for nutrition counseling , since dietitians were still interested in processed , packaged , ‘ industrial strength ’ edibles . long story short : numerous ms patients regained health even to the point of getting off disability and going back to work . diet is the key biochemical factor in health and wellness , which allopathic medicine still cannot seem to accept since it is steeped in chemical medicine , i.e. , toxic pharmaceuticals , which , in many diseases , only exacerbates the problem . the human organism was designed to function with high quality nutrients found in plant-based and some animal foods , as humans have ingested since time immemorial . only within the last century have laboratory-made – mostly petrochemical-based – pharmaceuticals displaced healing foods and modalities . nutrition was called quackery in the 1980s by those in the medical profession who thought they knew it all . i can remember an md , who was head of a hospital , asking me , “ don ’ t you think if there was something to nutrition , we ’ d know about it ? ” dr. greger ’ s work is a breath of fresh air and i compliment him and his team to the highest . my only hope is that the medical profession in its entirety expand their collective consciousness so as to include natural nutrition – not food processing industry nutrition – in med schools and throughout ancillary medical professions.you are right , when i reversed ms by diet on few hundreds patients , i heard all stupid arguments from my colleagues , being the only md in a department of neurology who was not prescribing sleeping pills and having my patients sleeping well . when the tension was too intense i changed my clinical research subject from ms to vascular to explore the bbb and then i was granted american patent for a rescue blood pump i am launching now . i want to be back to nutrition and neurodegenerative disease because i have enough data to know that something is possible to be done with the younger generation . eating is the fuel of life , i do not get why so may people are blind about that.doctors believe that i have 2nd progressive ms. i have been eating as vegan for 6 months . are you saying that i should eat salmon twice a week ? the diet as preventive medicine is a life long diet . twice wild fish a week as cold water cod , herring , salmon , salmon roe once a week these with a organic vegetarian diet may help you to prevent ms to worsen , i described signs of lymphocytes 1 week before relapse , then the 2nd step was to give antioxydants when these signs started for 3 weeks , i observed relapses 2 weeks after the ending the antioxydant treatment . in progressive ms , it is a mixture of chronic inflammatory response , worsening of scares and reactivation of old lesion . i like turmeric and ginger as anti-inflammatory nutriments , most of my patients with progressive ms felt improved adding that to their diet , salmon with ginger green tea rice which is a simple recipe , very japanese looks helping . gaba rice of course.can you eat flax or hemp seeds instead of fish to stay vegan ? yes you can and have seaweeds salads and soups tooi like hemp seed but i have no scientific evaluation . i just use it for me when i am very busy , i had a serious chronic disease , my diet works better than prescription.i have taken your advice regarding turmeric , ginger , and last night i made the ginger green tea gaba rice with a small piece of wild alaskan salmon with the skin on . i have to admit ; i am already walking better , and will continue to have the salmon twice a week for a few months , and see how i do . i am a little concerned about pcb ’ s though . thank you ! there is nothing special in salmon and other fish that isn ’ t found in in a better form in plant foods . however , seafood contains iodine , which is deficient in land based foods due to modern intensive farming practices stripping the soil . the abundance of flourine and chlorine in the modern world also displaces iodine from the body , so we need much more of it today . iodine is essential for the production of a thyroid hormone that is involved in the methylation process , which in in turn creates the methylcobalamin needed to build the myelin sheaths , the fatty protective layer around nerves which break down in people with ms.you would have had better results from consuming kombu / kelp , and would have avoided the cholesterol and saturated fats in the fish . you would have even better results adding drops of lugol ’ s iodine into a smoothie while taking a methylselenocysteine supplement ( selenium is essential for displacing halogens bound into iodine receptors . also if you take iodine while selenium deficient it will exacerbate that deficiency and affect your thyroid ) .take an algal supplement for omega 3s ( which are superior to fish supplements ) and / or consume 7g of flax , 20g of hemp or 4 walnuts . also eat plenty of berries and leafy greens which are high in omega 3s while being low in all other fats.thanks fruitbat ; i am not especially thrilled about eating meat again . it ’ s just that i have been a strict vegan for the last six months , and have greatly enjoyed eating whole food , but i have continued to loose my ability to walk . thanks for your suggestions ; i have been doing most of them including taking selenium ( plus eating beans twice a week ) , except for the kelp , and iodine . i will try this and see if it makes a difference in my abilities . i have been eating ground flax seeds , walnuts and flax oil for the omega 3 ’ s , but was thinking that there might be something to eating the omega 3 ’ s from a real fatty fish whole food source . i do want to continue to walk.i am so happy to help and hope it works out for you ! the lugol ’ s comes in different strengths ( from 2-15 % ) and qualities , some contain sodium iodide instead of the superior potassium iodide for example . don ’ t be afraid of consuming too much – in japan the average iodine intake from sea vegetable consumption is 13 milligrams a day , over 86 times higher than the rda of 150 micrograms recommended in the western world . one twelfth of a teaspoon of 7 % lugol ’ s contains 12.5 milligrams of iodine . 12.5 to 50 milligrams is considered by doctors who have studied iodine therapy to be a useful dose . it is best to start at the lower level , and consume it in a fruit smoothie as it disguises the taste while providing magnesium , which works with iodine in the body.it is important that the form of selenium is usable – the inorganic form such as selenite can be toxic if too much is consumed , and are difficult for the body to utilise . a good supplement is life extension se-methyl l selenocysteine.regarding omega 3 fats in fish , you ’ d have to consume 215g or nearly a whole fillet of salmon every day to provide enough , which would also give you 118 mg of cholesterol . additionally , it would give you 1.5g of methionine – more than you need in a day in a single piece of food – dr greger has a video about excessive methionine feeding cancer cells.algal supplements naturally contain dha and epa in a good 2 : 1 ratio , are free of mercury , and have not been chemically deodorized to disguise the smell of rotting fish . if your fat intake is low enough , the body can produce epa and dha from omega 3 ’ s found in plant foods , but a supplement can ’ t hurt if you feel you need one.on a personal note , i started the 80 / 10 / 10 high calorie raw fruit and leaf based diet several months ago , and while there were some general improvements in my health and appearance , i was disappointed that i didn ’ t get the incredible benefits claimed by other people , particularly in regard to my adhd . it is so disheartening and frustrating to be making the effort to do everything right and not see results . iodine was the missing link for me – sea vegetables are ignored ( though not prohibited ) on the 80 / 10 / 10 so if a person is already iodine deficient ( which is common , especially in sufferers of adhd ) this diet will not help to rectify the problem and may even make it worse . the same is true of a general plant based diet , since livestock fodder is fortified with iodine so that animal products provide small amounts , and people on plants based diets generally do not consume sea vegetables to make up for and better it.good luck to you , hopefully this extra information was helpful , and i really hope that supplementing with iodine will prove beneficial in reversing your msi am happy iy is working for you , making it part of your routine may help you significantly . thank you to share it.i ’ d just like to point out that vegans have always existed . meat eaters are overly fond of saying that humans have always eaten meat . no other primate habitually eats flesh , the only animal products other primates eat are insects.as someone who has lived with relapsing / remitting ms for about 27 years , this kind of upcoming report is very exciting to me . i own dr. swank ’ s book and have tried to model my diet on his , although i ’ ve never been 100 % faithful to the diet . i did want to correct an impression you gave in the article that interferon beta and chemo drugs are the only treatment options for ms. i ’ ve been on copaxone since 2000 and have had only one relapse during that time.i think at this point the best science supports dr. swank ’ s approach . you can read more about this issue on john mcdougall ’ s website which includes an interview with dr. swank . given the nature of the disease it is difficult and expensive to do good studies due to the time frames needed . i would not recommend meats or saturated fats at this time . hopefully the study that was funded by dr. mcdougall ’ s foundation will lead to a larger longer study . i can ’ t think of any downsides to his approach . i do know that if you have one chronic disease you don ’ t want another such as arterial disease or diabetes or cancer . good luck.the best science seems to show there is no effect . the study already has been published : http : / / www.neurology.org / content / 82 / 10 _ supplement / p6.152.shortthe study was not expected to show efficacy given the small numbers of participants ( 30 ) and limited time frame ( 1 year ) when considered relative to the natural time frame of ms ( years ) . dr. bourdette is hoping that this study will open the door to a much larger and longer term study which would be needed to actually show efficacy . so the best science is yet to come . it will most likely be done in europe as most studies in this country are done to test the use of drugs or procedures . i heard dr. bourdette speak at the mcdougall advanced study weekend at the time the study was funded . the interesting side note is it took the ethics committee at oregon health and science center a while to decide that a study which put participants on the intervention diet was safe ! so for now as i mentioned in my previous post i would recommend this approach to anyone who might have or does have ms. i have one patient who was wheel chair bound who benefited with better control of his type 1 diabetes and his wife says his stool problems have greatly improved . thanks for taking the time to comment and post the article … keep tuned to nf.org as the science keeps coming.the swank diet appears to include meat , eggs and dairy . it is not a vegan diet . to really benefit one needs to go vegan plus and eat a diet of whole organic plants while avoiding salt , sugar and refined carbohydrates. xyzmy sister has had ms for over 35 years . unfortunately , i do not think anybody shared the info generated by dr. swank ’ s research with her . we did not know it to share with her until the very recent years . she has been in a nursing home for about 13.5 years , unable to roll over in bed , or to move arms and legs . she is barely able to speak at this point , and has had stomach tube for liquid diet for years . she has been in hospice care for over a year . she is 63 years old . the disease has devastated her life.kathypoppyseed : re : ” unfortunately , i do not think anybody shared the info generated by dr. swank ’ s research with her . ” that ’ s just so criminal.this type of thing drives me * nuts . * dr. greger addresses this point yet again in his latest summary talk ( from table to able ) . our doctors and experts should be telling us what the science says . let us decide how we want to use that information . but they have no business patronizing us and hiding the information.ms is such a terrible disease , which your sister and you have first hand experience with . i ’ m sorry to hear about your situation.i switched over to a vegan diet recently and noticed an immediate improvement in terms of more energy and fat loss . i ’ m in medical school now and i believe that we will find out with more research that autoimmunity is the root cause of many seemingly unrelated diseases . my own theory is that the body gets confused by foreign animal proteins and mounts an autoimmune attack , and that the deleterious effects are only felt eventually over time . dr. greger has shown us countless studies on the benefits of a vegan diet . it really is a no-brainer at this point.what kind of food can i eat and could i get a recepie bookkags : i am not a doctor or expert and i do not know your situation . i can not make recommendations from either of those perspectives . however , i have purchased quite a few whole plant food based cookbooks over the last few years . i can recommend some books that based on my limited understanding would meet the needs of someone who is posting on this page.first , you might consider checking out dr. mcdougall ’ s book , the starch solution . the front part of the book contains some great info . and the back part contains some great recipes.while i just got , happy herbivore light and lean , i think it is going to be one of my favorite books . check it out ! if cost is an issue for you , check out vegan on the cheap ( and just don ’ t use oil for those recipes that call for it ) . for really simple recipes , check out vegan on $ 4 a day.if you have kids , check out let them eat vegan . ( or even if you don ’ t have kids , check it out . ) you might also want to check out some on-line resources , including pcrm ’ s site and the free 21 day kickstart program . they have a ton of free recipes that are healthy , tasty and easy to make.hope that helps.or appetite for reduction by isa chandra moshkowitzhttp : / / www.cpnhelp.org is an antibiotic protocol which has actually cured many many people.i feel like you are overpromising , dr. greger . my vegan friend with ms was vegan before her diagnosis ten years ago and has been vegan continuously for at least 3 decades . she is still crippled by her horrible ms symptoms.ms is as variable as humans are , to the extent that i call it “ the charlatan ’ s wet dream ” . whatever you pick , including nothing ( exercise , meditation , acupuncture , prayer , etc . ) , someone can point to it and say “ this worked for me ! ” . add biochemical individuality to spontaneous remission , the placebo effect , and confirmation bias , and stir in some charisma and scientific jargon , and you have a recipe for malady-based riches.she needs iodine . iodine . although being vegans doesn ’ t automatically mean one is eating a low saturated fat diet.read professor george jelinek ’ s book “ overcoming multiple sclerosis ” . he was diagnosed with ms in 1999 and due to his work as a professor of medicine , was in a position to access all the latest research about ms. his protocol is based on dr swank ’ s diet , vitamin d3 supplementation ( 5000iu daily ) , omega 3 as fish or flax oil daily , execise and meditation ( to alleviate stress ) . he has not had a relapse for about fourteen years . “ recovering from ms ” , also by jelinek , and law , is the stories of some of the people with ms who have used his protocol very successfully . he also has interviews on you tube.dr. greger , i ’ ll bring to your attention that mcdougall and yadav ’ s 1 year results have already been presented and published at 2014 american academy of neurology ’ s annual meeting . the results show no difference in presence of lesions , from mri scans . i refer you to : http : / / www.neurology.org / content / 82 / 10 _ supplement / p6.152 and http : / / www.healthline.com / health-news / low-fat-vegan-diet-may-ward-off-ms-fatigue-050614i do wish you would be equally vocal about studies that show no effect , at least as a reference to those who come to this page with high hopes.also bison is your alternative to beef . fish is also good for you . no beef , sugar or coffee . we are still working on the last 2 with my wifeit seems to me that there are two threads in this conversation , neither of which are recognizing the other . that can change , the recognition part , the conclusions do not need to change , necessarily . ok , on the one thread we have a description of doctor swank ’ s wor , which spans decades and has follow up results of both long and sort term duration . this thread also brings to the readers a recent controlled study initiated by dr. john mcdougall. the second thread is about the paleo diet and the results a physician got with that diet on her own case do multiple sclerosis . also sited is the commonality of large proportions of foods containing antioxidants . the book that woman wrote has been read by the participants in that thread . i have a sister who has had ms for 36 years . the last 13.5 years have been spent in a nursing home . the whole time she has been paralyzed , unable to move her arms or legs , unable to roll over , in bed without assistance . the last 5-7 years she has had a tube for feeding directly into her stomach , because she cannot swallow effectively . i could go on and on . she has been fed some variety of ensure , a liquid , which has kept her alive . she can also have snacks , of junk food , if someone feeds them to her , likeguess my reply was too long . i just want to concluded that i. do not think that my sister ever was told about dr. swank ’ s work . it is way too late for her now , but diet should be an integral , part of health care practices . ms is just one example of where that is so important . so people who understand that diet is so important ought to be getting on the same side in an effort to change established medical practices and establish food cultures . thanks , i have made my point poppyseedsomeone pointed out to me years ago that diet is the problem because in a lot of countries ms just don ’ t exist . i was very thankful for that infoa preliminary , not yet peer reviewed study released today reports no association between diet and ms. here is a link to a summary. http : / / www.medpagetoday.com / meetingcoverage / ectrims / 47667i find myself at a loss for what to believe . i suspect the study referenced above simply does not have enough participants following the actually food plan required to achieve the results we ’ d like to associate with a healthy vegan diet . anyone else feel like screaming ? oh , and note that in the study cited above , the only statistical correlation to reduced incidence of ms was high adherence to a western diet.yes , the authors have relationships with companies making ms products.she had amasing results . i don ’ t know if dr greger is aware of this ladyhttps : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = hlxxg49vzmui have 2 friends who have great results with their ms when they started taking juice plus + , and my own family has had amazing results as well ! can juice plus + help with multiple sclerosis ? though we cannot promise that juiceplus + will cure any illness or health condition , this is what i can say : ms is an autoimmune challenge that juice plus + can make a difference with , in time . it may take double the dosage , however , if the ms is severe.the immune study shows that b-cells become less hyperactive with juice plus + , i.e. make fewer antibodies against the body itself , which is the problem with all autoimmune disorders . autoimmune disorders show up in different ways in different people , manifesting symptoms based on our own unique genetic weaknesses.instead of focusing on the name of the disease , if we can go back to the cause of all autoimmune diseases – a trigger-happy immune system – then we do better . juice plus + makes the immune system less trigger-happy . “ clean eating fitness junkie ” http : / / www.facebook.com / jenpalbci invite you … to watch this video that could change your health & the health of your family in numerous ways ! http : / / safeshare.tv / w / ociscsvcthwe have been taking juice plus + capsules and drinking the complete shakes for a couple of years now . we ’ ve all experienced better sleep , healthier hair , nails , skin , teeth & gums , and a huge boost in our immune systems , which means we have more energy ! no flu ( and no , we do not get the flu shot ) ! ! i haven ’ t even had a cold ( knock on wood ) ! my husband & kids have had only 1 cold ! my husband & i compared our yearly physical blood work results from before & after starting juice plus + and all of our numbers improved ! our pediatrician was wondering where we ’ ve been , because the kids haven ’ t had a single “ sick visit ” in over 2 years ! we show up one a year for “ well child ” check-ups and that ’ s it ! my son used to catch strep-throat multiple times a year : ( ! the most amazing thing of all , and one of the reason i decided to promote this amazing whole food nutrition is my husband ’ s miraculous results while taking a double dose of juice plus + before & after his tonsillectomy , and all during & after his 6 weeks of daily radiation therapy . all 4 of his dr. ’ s kept asking “ how were you able to work so long while going through radiation ? ” and “ what ever you ’ re doing , keep it up ! ” “ i ’ ve never seen someone recover so quickly ! ” “ your health is incredible ! ” “ you are cured ! ” … .on and on and on.anyway , i just feel really passionate about this product and decided to promote it , in hopes that others can experience the vast improvements in health like we have . it ’ s also great for those with diabetes , because you can get all of your fruits & vegetables without any of the sugar ! i love that juice plus + is not a supplement … .it ’ s actual real food nutrition ! please let me know if you have any questions , or want more information . i would love to hear from you ! if you ’ d like to give juice plus + a try , please contact me or you can even go directly to my website and order from there.http : / / jennifer-palazzolo.juiceplus.com / content / juiceplus / en / what-is-juice-plus / what-is-juice-plus.html # .vebcypldxngone of the most compelling things about juice plus + is the fact that there have been over 30 research studies conducted in leading hospitals & universities around the world . the studies and results are available on my website : http : / / jennifer-palazzolo.juiceplus.com / content / juiceplus / en / clinical-research / clinical-research.htmlhave a great day ! jeni have ms since 2007 . my lifestyle and my nutrition were so bad but i had just one redicive i all my life , at the moment . when i ask the people who have ms as well , the people tell me almost the same , their lifestyle and nutrion are so f … bad . i don ´ t know if the vegetarian people have better life than people who eat meat but i think that we need some nutrients as vitamin b and we can ´ t find in veggies … we need vitamin d , we need omega 3 … and normally the people who eat the meat don ´ t have a good lifestyle ( because they meet trans-fat , drink sugar ¨ liquid ” as coca-cola , mcdonalds … . ) and the vegetarian people are interesting more in their nutrition … but i am totally sure … we need a god meat ! dear dr. greger , thank you for this article . the mcdougall ’ s study on multiple sclerosis and diet has been published and no real difference was seen between the “ diet ” and “ control ” groups in mri images ; nor was a difference in disability or relapses seen between the diet intervention and control groups . what is your opinion ? thank you.seriously wondering would fresh meat from a deli cause relapses also ? it might . deli meat still has loads of saturated fat so if high animal fat is one of the culprits then limiting or avoiding meat ( deli meat ) may be considered. acute myeloid leukemia , africa , aging , angiogram , animal fat , animal products , asia , autoimmune diseases , beef , bladder disease , bladder health , brain disease , brain health , cardiovascular health , chemotherapy , chicken , cholesterol , cognition , dairy , dr. caldwell esselstyn , dr. dean ornish , dr. john mcdougall , dr. roy swank , eggs , europe , eye disease , eye health , fat , fatigue , heart disease , heart health , inflammation , ldl cholesterol , leukemia , low-fat diets , meat , medications , milk , mortality , multiple sclerosis , nerve health , norway , pain , plant-based diets , pork , poultry , pritikin , saturated fat , sausage , side effects , surgery , tremors , turkey , vegans , vegetarians , vision weakness - -\n",
